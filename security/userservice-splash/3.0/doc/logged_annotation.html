<h1>Integrating the "userservice" with Splash</h1>

<p>If you are using the Splash MVC framework, there is a special package to help you
integrate the "userservice" with Splash. The package name is "security/userservice_splash".</p>

<h2>The <b>@Logged</b> filter</h2>

<p>This filter can be used in any action. If you put this annotation, the user will be denied access
if he is not logged in.</p>

<pre>
/**
 * A sample default action that requires to be logged.
 *
 * @Action
 * @Logged
 */
public function defaultAction() { ... }
</pre>

<p>The <b>@Logged</b> annotation requires an instance of <a href="userservice_package.html">UserService</a> to exist. The
name of the instance must be "userService".</p>
<p>If your UserService instance is not named "userService" (or if you want to use several UserService instances,
you can specify the instance of UserService to use in parameter of the annotation:</p>

<pre>
/**
 * A sample default action that requires to be logged.
 * The "myUserService" Mouf instance will be used to check
 * whether the user is logged or not.
 *
 * @Action
 * @Logged("myUserService")
 */
public function defaultAction() { ... }
</pre>
