/**
 * A typical implementation of the the MoufRightInterface.
 * This class represents a basic right. A right can be anything from displaying a button to accessing a web-page, etc...
 * Rights can optionally have a scope. If they have a scope, the user can have that right
 * only in that scope. For instance, in a project management application, there can be several project, 
 * and maybe the user as rights to manage only one project. So the "AdminProject" right might be restricted to
 * that particular project.
