<h1>Integrating the "rightsservice" with Splash</h1>

<p>If you are using the Splash MVC framework, there is a special package to help you
integrate the "rightsservice" with Splash. The package name is "security/rightsservice_splash".
Please note this package does not apply if you are using Druplash.</p>

<p>This package provides a number of useful filters:</p>

<h2>The <b>@RequiresRight</b> filter</h2>

<p>This filter can be used in any action. If you put this annotation, the user will be denied access
if he does not possess the specified right.</p>

<pre>
/**
 * A sample default action that requires to have the "ACCESS_ADMIN_RIGHT" right.
 *
 * @Action
 * @RequiresRight(name="ACCESS_ADMIN_RIGHT")
 */
public function defaultAction() { ... }
</pre>

<p>The <b>@RequiresRight</b> annotation requires an instance of <a href="rightsservice_package.html">RightsService</a> to exist. The
name of the instance must be "rightsService".</p>
<p>If your RightsService instance is not named "rightsService" (or if you want to use several RightsService instances,
you can specify the instance of UserService to use in parameter of the annotation:</p>

<pre>
/**
 * A sample default action that requires to have the "ACCESS_ADMIN_RIGHT" right.
 *
 * @Action
 * @RequiresRight(name="ACCESS_ADMIN_RIGHT",instance="myRightService")
 */
public function defaultAction() { ... }
</pre>
