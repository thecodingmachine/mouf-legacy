    Stubbles is a PHP 5 framework. We are developing it mainly to build web
    applications based on XML and XSLT. But Stubbles is very modular, so
    you may use single packages like the Extended Reflection Features, the XML
    packages or the Inversion of Control container, without worrying about our
    MVC architecture.

    This reference guide covers all important topics that you need to know when
    working with any aspects of Stubbles.
