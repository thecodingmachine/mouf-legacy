/**
 * The SplashUrlAnalyzer component is in charge of binding an Url to a Controller.
 * There is one and only one instance of SplashUrlAnalyzer per web application.
 * The name of the instance MUST be "splashUrlAnalyzer".
 * 
 * The SplashUrlAnalyzer has several ways to bind an URL to a Controller.
 * It can do so:
 * - using the instance name of a controller that has been instanciated with Mouf.
 * For instance, if a controller has an instance name that is "myController", then
 * the http://[myserver]/[mywebapp]/myController URL will lead to the default action
 * of that controller.
 * The http://[myserver]/[mywebapp]/myController/myAction URL will lead to the myAction action
 * of that controller. 
 * 
 * @Component
 * @RequiredInstance "splashUrlAnalyzer"
