<p>The error handler package is a package whose goal is to make it easier to handle
PHP errors and exceptions.</p>

<p>You might be aware that by default, PHP comes with a <code>set_error_handler</code> and a 
<code>set_exception_handler</code> functions that allow you to catch any non fatal error or
any uncatched exception, and act accordingly. The point is you can only have one function
registered to handle errors and one for exceptions.</p>

<p>The <b>Error Handler</b> package allows you to add many functions to handle errors, and
furthermore, it provides meaningful defaults.</p>

<h2>Error Handler default behaviour</h2>

<p>By default, Error Handler will improve on the way errors are managed by PHP. All PHP notices/warnings/errors
will be displayed in a nice HTML table, with a complete stacktrace. By clicking on a function of the
stacktrace, you will be able to see the parameters passed to the function, which can be incredibly helpful
to solve your problem. Exceptions handling will also benefit from the same HTML rendering. Furthermore,
the PHP error log will also be filled with a complete stacktrace so you can easily understand what is going on.</p>

<p>To get this behaviour, all you have to do is simply to enable the package, but wait, there is more....</p>

<h2>Configuring the way errors  are handled</h2>

<p>After installing the package, have a look at the instances it created. One of the instances is
called "defaultGlobalErrorHandler". This instance will receive all the errors and all the uncaught exceptions
from your application. It will forward those errors to all the registered error handlers.</p>

<p>Error handlers are classes implementing the "ErrorHandlerInterface". It is fairly easy to implement
so you can add your own.</p>

<h2>Error handlers provided with this package</h2>

<p>By default, there are 3 errors handlers provided in this package:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>ToOutputErrorHandler:</b> this error handler renders the errors in HTML, directly in the
	output (so in the browser for most applications). It is enabled by default when you install the package.</li>
	<li><b>ToPhpErrorLogErrorHandler:</b> this error handler logs errors in the PHP error log.
	It is enabled by default when you install the package.</li>
	<li><b>ToLogErrorHandler:</b> this error handler is very powerful. It acts as a connector between
	the error handler and the Mouf log system. So basically, it can redirect any error or exception to
	any log in Mouf. The point is Mouf has a lot of loggers. Some can write in database, some can send
	mails, some can even apply advanced statistics on the number of log messages received. So basically,
	by forwarding your errors to the log system, you can send your error about anywhere, without coding
	a single line of code, just by wiring the instances together using Mouf. And that's cool!</li>
</ul>

<p>And as usual, you can add more error handlers if you like.</p>

<h2>If you are planning to write your own error handlers...</h2>

<p>If you plan to write your own error handlers, you will probably need at some point to render
the PHP error, or the PHP exception into HTML, or text, so the developer can read it.
In the errorhandler package, the task of rendering an error or an exception is done by objects
implementing the ErrorRendererInterface (for rendering errors) and the ExceptionRendererInterface (for
rendering exceptions). By default, the errorhandler package comes with 2 renderers:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>errorHtmlRenderer</b> that can render both errors and exceptions in HTML</li>
	<li><b>errorTextRenderer</b> that can render both errors and exceptions in full text</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not hesitate to use those instances if you want. Alternatively, you can add your own
renderer class and keep using the provided error handlers, since those handlers are relying on
the renderers to transform errors and exceptions into HTML or text.</p>
