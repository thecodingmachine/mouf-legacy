<h1>Mouf's BlackListMailService</h1>

<h2>Authorizing users to unsubscribe from a mailing-list</h2>

<p>In Mouf, <em>emails</em> are sent using <em>MailServices</em>.<br/>
This package contains a mailer that does not send any mail! Instead, it modifies a mail to add an "unsubscribe" link
at the bottom of the mail. Then, it forwards the mail to a DBMailService, that will store the mail in database.
Finally, the mail will be forwarded to a "real" mail service that will really send the mail.
</p>

<p>If a user asked to be unsubscribed from a mailing list, any attempt to send a mail later will be refused by the BlackListMailService.</p>
<p>The list of mails that are black-listed is stored in the <strong>outgoing_mail_blacklist</strong> table.</p>

<p>If you pass an instance of <strong>DBMailInterface</strong> (instead of simply a MailInterface) to the <strong>sendMail</strong> method, 
you can add a category and a type to your mail. A category/type couple will be considered to be a "mailing list" and if the user
wants to unsubscribe, we will have the ability to unsubscribe from this mailing list, or from any mailing lists you might subscribe him to.</p>

<div class="warning">In order to add an "unsubscribe" link at the end of the mail, your mail must have only one "To:" recipient. If you 
have more than one recipient, the BlackListMailService will simply forward the mail without adding the unsubscribe link.</div>

<h2>Installing BlackListMailService</h2>

<p>There is an install process for this package. It will require to provide a valid <strong>DB_MySqlConnection</strong>. The install
process will create the <strong>outgoing_mail_blacklist</strong> table.</p>

<p>The install process will create a BlackListMailService instance in Mouf and will automatically bind that instance to the dbMailService instance.</p>
<p>By default, the unsubscribe link text is defined in the package, but you can overwrite the text by configuring the BlackListMailService instance.</p>

<h2>Usage sample</h2>

<p>You use this service as you would use any MailService.</p>

<p>
For instance, to send a mail, you just need to write:
</p>
<pre class="brush:php">
$mailService = Mouf::getBlackListMailService();

$mail = new DBMail();
$mail-&gt;setBodyText("This is my mail!");
$mail-&gt;setBodyHtml("This is my &lt;b&gt;mail&lt;/b&gt;!");
$mail-&gt;setFrom(new MailAddress("my@server.com", "Server"));
$mail-&gt;addToRecipient(new MailAddress("david@email.com", "David"));
$mail-&gt;setTitle("My mail");
$mail-&gt;setCategory("My category");
$mail-&gt;setType("My type");

$mailService-&gt;send($mail);
</pre>
<p>The code above assumes that you configured an instance in Mouf called "blackListMailService".</p>

<h2>Manually adding/removing unsubscribed users</h2>

<p>The BlackListMailService offers a number of methods you can use to add or remove mail addresses from the black list.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>unsubscribe</strong> method to add a mail address to the black list.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>isBlackListed</strong> method to know if a mail address is black-listed.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>cancelUnsubscribe</strong> method to remove a mail address to the black list.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Accessing the unsubscribed database</h2>

<p>You can access the blacklisted mails table directly from the Mouf administration interface.
You just need to click on the <b>Utils</b> menu and click the <b>View blacklisted mails</b> submenu.</p>

<h2>Configuring the BlackListMailService</h2>

<p>The BlackListMailService instance in Mouf allows many configuration. Using the instance you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the text of the unsubscribe link, or change any translation is you are running in an i18n environment</li>
<li>Change the link of the unsubscribe link. If you change the link, you will be responsible for providing a web page that will
allow the user to unsubscribe</li>
<li>Define a "needle". This is a text that will be replaced by the unsubscribe link. This way, the unsubscribe link does not
have to be stored at the bottom of the mail. You can put it where you want in your mail.</li>
<li>Define a "serverName". You must do this if your mail is sent from the PHP CLI, as your script will have no way to know
the fully qualified domain name of your web server (for the unsubscribe link).</li>
</ul>
