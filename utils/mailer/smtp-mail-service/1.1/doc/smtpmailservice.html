<h1>The SmtpMailService</h1>

<p>
The <code>SmtpMailService</code> is used to send mails using a SMTP mail server.
The instance of the class takes one compulsory parameter: <b>host</b>, which is the address of the server.
</p>

<p>By default, on Linux systems, it is likely you will use the local mail server (host=127.0.0.1). You will have a "sendmail" or "postfix" server installed
on your machine.</p>
<p>If you are performing your developments on a Windows machine, it is quite likely that you will not have an SMTP server on your machine. You will 
therefore have to use a remote server. To access the remote server, you will certainly have to use login/passwords, etc...</p>

<p>When this package is installed, it will create a default "smtpMailService" instance and will ask you to configure this instance.</p>

<h2>Tip: using your gmail account to send mails</h2>

<p>In a development environment, it can be useful to use you gmail account. Here are the settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>host =&gt; 'smtp.gmail.com'</li>
<li>ssl =&gt; 'tls'</li>
<li>port =&gt; 587</li>
<li>auth =&gt; 'login'</li>
<li>username => <em>Your gmail mail address</em></li>
<li>password => <em>Your password</em></li>
</ul>
