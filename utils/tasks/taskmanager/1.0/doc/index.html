<h1>Managing tasks with the Task Manager</h1>

<p>A package in Mouf is available to manage tasks: Task Manager (and its associated package Task Manager UI)</p>
<p>With the Task Manager package, you can plan tasks. Tasks are bits of code that can run at some date.
They are regularly retried if the task is not run successfully.</p>

<p>Use the Task Manager UI package to have a nice interface to check the status of the tasks.</p>

<h2>Installing the Task Manager package</h2>

<p>Installing the Task Manager package is easy. You first need to enable the package (utils/tasks/taskmanager).</p>
<p>Then, you must create the tasks table in your database. The script to create the table is available in <code>plugins/utils/tasks/taskmanager/1.0/database</code>.</p>

<p>Now, you have to create an instance of the TaskManager class in Mouf. The TaskManager class is the class you will use to create new tasks.</p>
<p>Connect, to the Mouf interface, then click on "Create a new instance", and select the TaskManager class. You can specify "taskManager" as the instance name.</p>

<p>You must configure the TaskManager. In particular, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect the TaskManager to the DbConnection representing your database</li>
<li>Connect the TaskManager to a logger that will log all actions related to the TaskManager</li>
</ul>

<p>You are done? Let's start using the TaskManager!</p>

<h2>Building Tasks</h2>

<p>The TaskManager can be used to start "Tasks".</p>
<p>You start a new Task by calling the createTask method:</p>

<pre>
Mouf::getTaskManager->createTask($myTaskProcessor, array("myParam"=>1, "myOtherParam"=>42));
</pre>

<p>In this example, $myTaskProcessor is a Mouf instance of a "TaskProcessor". A TaskProcessor is a bit of code that you will write to act upon a task. The task processor will be passed the second arguments of the function call (the task parameters).</p>

<p>TaskProcessors are objects implementing the TaskProcessorInterface interface. It is a very easy to implement interface, since there are only 3 method calls to implement: <code>run</code>, <code>getTaskName</code> and <code>getRetryInterval</code></p>

interface TaskProcessorInterface {
	/**

	public function run(Task $task);
	
	/**

	 * This is used to display the task in the UI.
	 * 
	 * @param Task $task
	 */
	public function getTaskName(Task $task);
	
	/**
	 * The getRetryInterval function returns the number of seconds to wait before retrying the task (if the task failed).
	 * The TaskManager will do its best to call the retry. Please note there is no guarantee it will run exactly at
	 * the specified time. The time the task will run depends first on the time the TaskManager is called (by a cron task
	 * or any other mechanism).
	 * 
	 * @param Task $task
	 * @return int
	 */
	public function getRetryInterval(Task $task);
}
?>
</pre>

<p>Here is a sample task:</p>

<pre>
/**
 * This is a sample implementation of the TaskProcessorInterface interface.
 * @Component
 */
class MyTaskProcessor implements TaskProcessorInterface {
	/**
	 * The run method performs the action on the task.
	 * It returns "true" if the task was run successfully,
	 * or "false" if the task failed (if the task failed,
	 * it will be retried later).
	 * 
	 * @param Task $task
	 * @return boolean
	 */
	public function run(Task $task) {
		// You can access task parameters using the getParams() method:
		$myParams = $task->getParams();

	}
	
	/**
	 * Returns a string describing the task.
	 * This is used to display the task in the UI.
	 * 
	 * @param Task $task
	 */
	public function getTaskName(Task $task) {
		return "Sample task with param: ".$task->getParams()->myParam;
	}
	
	/**
	 * The getRetryInterval function returns the number of seconds to wait before retrying the task (if the task failed).
	 * The TaskManager will do its best to call the retry. Please note there is no guarantee it will run exactly at
	 * the specified time. The time the task will run depends first on the time the TaskManager is called (by a cron task
	 * or any other mechanism).
	 * 
	 * @param Task $task
	 * @return int
	 */
	public function getRetryInterval(Task $task) {
		// Retry once an hour.
		return 3600;
	}
}
</pre>

<p>Please note that the TaskProcessor has the @Component attribute. It MUST be created as a Mouf instance. The next step is therefore to register it as a Mouf instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Mouf UI, start by importing your PHP file containing the MyTaskProcessor class: "Include PHP files".</li>
<li>Now, create a new instance of that object: "Create a new instance". Then select your class ("MyTaskProcessor"), and an instance name (for instance: "myTaskProcessor").</li>
</ul>

<h2>Running tasks</h2>

<p>To run a task, you just need to call the createTask method, passing in parameter the TaskProcessor in charge of the task:</p>

<pre>
$taskProcessor = Mouf::getMyTaskProcessor();
Mouf::getTaskManager()->createTask($taskProcessor, $myParams);
</pre>

<h2>Viewing awaiting tasks</h2>

<p>The TaskManager package comes with a user interface to see awaiting tasks. Just connect to Mouf UI, and click the "View awaiting tasks" link.</p>

<h2>Installing a CRON job to run the tasks</h2>

<p>The TaskManager will not trigger automagically when a task reaches the retry date. Instead, it needs to be fired regularly from a cron job (if you are using Linux) or any other job scheduler.</p>
<p>The TaskManager package can assist you in setting up the CRON job. Just click the "Install Task Manager" menu, and you will be able to view installation instructions.</p>
