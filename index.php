		<h1>Welcome to the Mouf framework</h1>
		
		<p>Apparently, this is the first time you are running Mouf. You will need to install it.</p>
		<p>Please click the install button below. This will create and install a ".htaccess" file in the "Mouf" directory.
		This will also create 4 files in your root directory: Mouf.php, MoufComponents.php, MoufRequire.php and MoufUniversalParameters.php (if they don't already exist)</p>
		<p>Please make sure that the Mouf directory is writable by your web-server.</p>
