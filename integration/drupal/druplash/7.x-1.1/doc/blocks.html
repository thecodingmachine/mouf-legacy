<h1>Dynamic blocks with Druplash</h1>

<p>If you went through <a href="tutorial.html">the tutorial</a>, you should know that all the content
that is outputed (using 'echo' or 'print') will be displayed in your template's "Content" section.
Of course, there might be times where you will need to display some dynamic content in the top section,
in the left or right column, or in the footer. To do this in a pure Drupal style, you would use
blocks, with some PHP code in the blocks. Druplash does not remove the notion of blocks that is
at the core of Drupal. Instead, Druplash binds Mouf instances with Drupal block. Let's see
how this works.</p>

<h2>The DrupalDynamicBlock class</h2>

<p>When you want to create a block in Drupal that will contain dynamic content generated by your
controller, you can create a "DrupalDynamicBlock" instance in Mouf.</p>

<p>Go to <em>Menu &gt; Components &gt; Create a new instance</em>. Select the "DrupalDynamicBlock" and name it
'myDynamicBlock'. As you can see, a dynamic block contains a number of parameters that are all explained in the page. 
The parameters you should care about are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>name:</strong> the name of the Druplash block, as displayed in the Drupal block administration screen</li>
	<li><strong>subject:</strong> the title of the block (it will be displayed each time the block is displayed)</li>
	<li><strong>content:</strong> you can put here any instance extending the HtmlElementInterface class (an element
	extending the HtmlElementInterface can be displayed in HTML). However, there are easier ways to use the block
	as we will see</li>
</ul>

<p>Once your block is created, you can see it is Drupal's block administration interface. Go in this interface, and
place the block where you want it to be (left column, header, footer, etc...)</p>

<p>Now, we need to write into the block. We will do this from the controller:</p>

<pre>
/**
 * @Component
 */
class MyController extends DrupalController {
	
	/**
	 * @Property
	 * @var DrupalDynamicBlockInterface
	 */
	public $myDynamicBlock;
	
	/**
	 * @Action
	 * @URL hello/world
	 */
	public function index() {
		$this-&gt;myDynamicBlock-&gt;addContentText('Hello world!');
	}
}
</pre>

<p>In this example, please notice the we add a property to the controller named "myDynamicBlock". This property will have to
be bound to the DrupalDynamicBlock we previously created (go to your controller's instance, and select your block in the
dropdown for the "myDynamicBlock" property).</p>

<p>As you can see, writing in a block as easy, you just need to use the appropriate function. As usual in SplashMVC, there
are 4 different functions to write in the block:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>addContentText:</strong> to directly write a text into the block</li>
	<li><strong>addContentFunction:</strong> will call a function. The output of the function will be written into the block</li>
	<li><strong>addContentFile:</strong> will include a file. The content of the file will be outputed in the block</li>
	<li><strong>addContentHtmlElement:</strong> will add an object implementing the HtmlElementInterface. The "toHtml()" method
	of the object will be called and displayed in the block</li>
</ul>
