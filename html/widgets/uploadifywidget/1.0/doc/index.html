<h1>The Uploadify Widget</h1>

<p>The uploadify widget can be used to generate an "upload" button that will perform file uploading in Ajax (actually via a Flash plugin).
The user can see the upload progress bar, and you can trigger actions when the file upload is complete (in PHP server-side, and in Javascript, client side).</p>

<p>To be successfully used, you first need to import jQuery, and uploadify JS and CSS files in your PHP page.
Once this is done, you will need to create an instance of the UploadifySingleFileWidget in Mouf. Call $instance-&gt;toHtml() to render the widget in 
your HTML page (or include your instance in a container).</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<img src="uploadifyinstancescreenshot.png" alt="uploadify instance screenshot" />

<p>Below is a list of the main parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>directory</b>: The destination directory for the file to be written. If it does not start with "/", this is relative to ROOT_PATH. 
The directory is created if it does not exist.<br/>
You can of course set this value dynamically, in your code, using
<pre>$instance-&gt;directory = "my/directory";</pre></li>
<li><b>fileName</b>: The destination file name for the file to be written. This is a unique file name and cannot contain "/".
Most of the time, you will set this value dynamically, in your code, using
<pre>$instance-&gt;fileName = "myFileName.ext";</pre>
</li>
<li><b>fileExtensions</b>: The list of file extensions for the files to upload, separated by a ";".
<p>For instance: *.jpg;*.gif;*.png</p></li>
<li><b>fileDescription</b>: The $fileDescription option sets the text that will appear in the file type drop down in the file selection system window.
<p>This option is required when using the $fileExtensions option.
For instance: 'Web Image Files (.JPG, .GIF, .PNG)'</p></li>
<li><b>fileId</b>: If you want to trigger some code when the file is uploaded, you will need to give the file a unique ID.
You should set this ID programmatically, using:
<pre>$instance-&gt;fileId = $myId;</pre>
Then, you should register a listener that will be triggered when the file is uploaded (see the "listeners"
property). The ID will be passed to the listener when an upload is completed.</li>
<li><b>listeners</b>: Use this property to register "listeners" that will be triggered when a file upload is performed.
To be registered, an instance should implement the UploadifyOnUploadInterface interface.</li>
<li><b>onCompleteJavascriptFunction</b>: Use this property to register a Javascript function that will be triggered as soon as
an upload is complete. See <a href="http://www.uploadify.com/documentation/events/oncomplete-2/">the uploadify doc</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using listeners</h2>

<p>To develop a listerner, you must write a class with the @Component annotation implementing the <code>UploadifyOnUploadInterface</code> interface.</p>
<p>Create an instance of this class, and bind that instance the the "listeners" property of your uplodify widget instance.</p>

<p>Here is the interface to be implemented:</p>
<pre>
interface UploadifyOnUploadInterface {
	
	/**
	 * This method is called by an UploadifySingleFileWidget when an upload is complete.
	 * 
	 * &lt;p&gt;Please note the 5th parameter is passed in reference. It is a PHP array containing additional data
	 * to be passed back to the page. The PHP array will be converted to JSON and be sent to the page.
	 * You can put additional parameters in this array, and read those parameters in your page, using the
	 * onCompleteJavascriptFunction property that will trigger some Javascript function when the upload
	 * is complete, client-side.&lt;/p&gt;
	 * 
	 * &lt;p&gt;The $result array will always contain one key:&lt;/p&gt;
	 * &lt;pre&gt;$result = array("status"=&gt;"error|ok")&lt;/pre&gt;
	 * 
	 * @param string $tmpFile The temporary path to the uploaded file.
	 * @param string $destFile The final path of the uploaded file. When the onUpload method is called, the file is not yet there. In this function, you can change the value of $destFile since it is passed by reference
	 * @param string $fileId The fileId that was set in the uploadify widget (see UploadifySingleFileWidget::fileId)
	 * @param UploadifySingleFileWidget $widget
	 * @param array $result The result array that will be returned to the page as a JSON object.
	 * @param string $uploadedFileName The name of the uploaded file
	 * @return boolean Return false to cancel the upload
	 */
	public function onUpload($tmpFile, &$destFile, $fileId, UploadifySingleFileWidget $widget, array &amp;$result, $uploadedFileName);
}
</pre>

<p>As you can see, using the listener, you must return true to authorize the upload. If you return false, the upload will be canceled.
You can access the file being uploaded using its temporary name ($tmpFile), and the unique file ID will be given to you in the $fileId
parameter (if you previously did set the fileId).</p>

<p>You can pass back parameters in your Javascript code using the $result parameter. This parameter is a simple PHP array.
Is is passed in reference, so you can modify it in your method, and the changes will be transmited to the Javascript complete callback.</p>

<h3>Listener example</h3>

<p>Below is a listener example. It checks that the uploaded file is an image, and returns the width and height of the image to the calling script.</p>

<pre>
public function onUpload($tmpFile, &$destFile, $fileId, UploadifySingleFileWidget $widget, array &amp;$result, $uploadedFileName) {
	$file_info = getimagesize($tmpFile);
	if(empty($file_info)) // No Image?
	{
		$result['msg'] = "The uploaded file doesn't seem to be an image"; 
		return false;
	}
	
	$result['width'] = $file_info[0];
	$result['height'] = $file_info[1];
	return true;
}
</pre>

<p>And you can get the result back in javascript in your page:</p>

<pre>
function onUploadComplete(event, ID, fileObj, response, data) {
	var jsonResponse = jQuery.parseJSON(response);
	if (jsonResponse == "error") {
		alert('An error occurred during the upload of your image. Please try again');
	} else {
		alert('Image successfully loaded. Width: '+jsonResponse.width+" - Height: "+jsonResponse.height);
	}
}
</pre>
