<h1>The Uploadify Widget</h1>

<p>The uploadify widget can be used to generate an "upload" button that will perform file uploading in Ajax (actually via a Flash plugin).
The user can see the upload progress bar, and you can trigger actions when the file upload is complete (in PHP server-side, and in Javascript, client side).</p>

<p>To be successfully used, you will need to create an instance of the UploadifySingleFileWidget in Mouf. Call $instance-&gt;toHtml() to render the widget in 
your HTML page (or include your instance in a container).</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<img src="uploadifyinstancescreenshot.png" alt="uploadify instance screenshot" />

<p>Below is a list of the main parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>directory</b>: The destination directory for the file to be written. If it does not start with "/", this is relative to ROOT_PATH. 
The directory is created if it does not exist.<br/>
You can of course set this value dynamically, in your code, using
<pre>$instance-&gt;directory = "my/directory";</pre></li>
<li><b>fileName</b>: The destination file name for the file to be written. This is a unique file name and cannot contain "/".
Most of the time, you will set this value dynamically, in your code, using
<pre>$instance-&gt;fileName = "myFileName.ext";</pre>
</li>
<li><b>fileExtensions</b>: The list of file extensions for the files to upload, separated by a ";".
<p>For instance: *.jpg;*.gif;*.png</p></li>
<li><b>fileDescription</b>: The $fileDescription option sets the text that will appear in the file type drop down in the file selection system window.
<p>This option is required when using the $fileExtensions option.
For instance: 'Web Image Files (.JPG, .GIF, .PNG)'</p></li>
<li><b>fileId</b>: If you want to trigger some code when the file is uploaded, you will need to give the file a unique ID.
You should set this ID programmatically, using:
<pre>$instance-&gt;fileId = $myId;</pre>
Then, you should register a listener that will be triggered when the file is uploaded (see the "listeners"
property). The ID will be passed to the listener when an upload is completed.</li>
<li><b>listeners</b>: Use this property to register "listeners" that will be triggered when a file upload is performed.
To be registered, an instance should implement the UploadifyOnUploadInterface interface.</li>
<li><b>onCompleteJavascriptFunction</b>: Use this property to register a Javascript function that will be triggered as soon as
an upload is complete. See <a href="http://www.uploadify.com/documentation/events/oncomplete-2/">the uploadify doc</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using listeners</h2>

<p>To develop a listerner, you must write a class with the @Component annotation implementing the <code>UploadifyOnUploadInterface</code> interface.</p>
<p>Create an instance of this class, and bind that instance the the "listeners" property of your uplodify widget instance.</p>

<p>Here is the interface to be implemented:</p>
<pre>
interface UploadifyOnUploadInterface {
	
	/**
	 * This method is called by an UploadifySingleFileWidget when an upload is complete.
	 * 
	 * @param string $tmpFile The temporary path to the uploaded file.
	 * @param string $destFile The final path of the uploaded file. When the onUpload method is called, the file is not yet there.
	 * @param string $fileId The fileId that was set in the uploadify widget (see UploadifySingleFileWidget::fileId)
	 * @param UploadifySingleFileWidget $widget
	 * @return boolean Return false to cancel the upload
	 */
	public function onUpload($tmpFile, $destFile, $fileId, UploadifySingleFileWidget $widget);
}
</pre>

<p>As you can see, using the listener, you must return true to authorize the upload. If you return false, the upload will be canceled.
You can access the file being uploaded using its temporary name ($tmpFile), and the unique file ID will be given to you in the $fileId
parameter (if you previously did set the fileId).</p>
