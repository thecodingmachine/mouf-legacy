	<displayName>Javascript/CSS library manager</displayName>
	<shortDescription>The Javascript/CSS library manager is a PHP class in charge of keeping track of the JS and CSS files that
	have been included so far in a web page. Basically, you tell the Javascript/CSS library manager to import a JS/CSS file and
	it will make sure it is included, only once, and that all dependencies are included as well.</shortDescription>
