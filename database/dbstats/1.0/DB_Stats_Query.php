/**
 * A class specialized in querying data stored in a aggregate table created with the DB_Stats class.
 *
 * To build a query, we are starting from the columns of the dimensions.
 * For each column, we have 3 possible choices:
 * - Filter on that column (for instance, display only the year 2008)
 * - Do not filter and display everything (display all the years)
 * - Sum up the content of the column (let's display the sum for all the years).
 * 
 * Please note that it is the responsibility of the developer to query according to the dimensions.
 * For instance, if one dimension is "year->month->day", the developer CANNOT sum up years but filter on the month:
 * You must first apply filters, then sum the latest columns of the dimension if you want.
 *
